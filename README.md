# Billionaires
 

The data set, published by Forbes and updated daily, includes each billionaire's current net worth, ranking, components of their wealth, some demographic information and other financial information. One of the main purposes of the dataset is to rank the documented net worth of the world's richest billionaires by year.

Within the scope of this project, the distribution of billionaires will be examined according to different industries, countries and regions. The distribution of billionaires' age, gender and place of birth will be examined. The rates of self-made billionaires and those who inherited their wealth will be compared. Economic indicators such as GDP and CPI of the countries where billionaires live will be examined, and the relationships between these indicators will be analyzed. With “spatial analysis”, the geographical distribution of billionaires around the world will be summarized with graphs.
